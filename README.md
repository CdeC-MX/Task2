# Second task: Propose a new sensing technique or a modification to an existing sensing technique.

The student is tasked with performing a literature search on the current testing methods of Covid-19 and will select one which is of his/her interest (Molecular, Antigen or Antibody). They will then proceed to either propose a new sensing technique (EG. Optical, Electrochemical, etc.) for that given application or propose a modification for an already existing test such that its performance could potentially increase.

## Remember that the end goal is to have a deliverable or set of deliverables among which you can have.

- A presentation.
- A video
- An infographic
- A webpage
- Many other things, be sure to ask us about it and we'll tell you if it's ok!

### What projects can I do?
Remember that this is a general track and you have the freedom to explore alternatives and take this into new and unknown directions, please be sure to talk with an instructor beforehand in order to determine what could be an interesting thing to do. 
- Perhaps you want to focus on a new sensing technique and you decide to focus on the cost dimension of the device. A project focusing on this perspective can:
  - Deconstruct the sensor into its components.
  - Draft a budget. 
  - Draw a schematic.
  - Describe the process of operation of the device, including materials and personel used.
- You could instead focus on performance and propose a high complexity diagnostic where your main focus in the experimental design, you will explain the testing process in great detail along with the control measures that will need to be kept in place to guarantee a good result (using sensitivity and specificity measures as well). 
- Maybe you're working with a sensor that has already been built and you will instead perform a critical evaluation of the device and state what could be done to allow such a device to enter the market. There are many paths to take but remember that this challenge takes a lot of time so be sure you choose something that you like!

The project is expected to be very throughout but reasonable, if you want to propose a new sensor you should probably include an estimated budget but you don't need to find the exact price. If you want to simulate your results you don't have to actually run the test, just explain which results you want to focus on and what would be a reasonable improvement.
